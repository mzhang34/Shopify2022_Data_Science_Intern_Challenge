# Shopify2022_Data_Science_Intern_Challenge

Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 

**Candidate Response:** The over-estimated AOV is likely caused by outliers as average values are highly sensitive to outliers. After exploring the data further (feel free to refer to my other file that has detailed steps in Python), I have identified user_id 607 is suspicious of committing fraud transaction with multiple high value transactions in the same store and the shop_idv 78 has pricy items which seem to be unintended for the purpose of our target population (in my understanding, we only want to look at sneaker shops with relative affordable price). These are the outliers that impacted our initial calculation and drope the AOV to $3145.13. One way to handle this is to remove the outliers and report the new AOV which is $302.58. Or we can simply adopt the median value which is $284 for the original dataset to reflect a sense of true average order value.

b.	What metric would you report for this dataset?
**Candidate Response:** I will report the reclculated AOV

c.	What is its value?
**Candidate Response:** $302.58

Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

a.	How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total? 
**Candidate Response:** 54
**Query **

SELECT count(OrderID) as Speedy_Express_Orders
FROM Orders
JOIN Shippers
ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
WHERE ShipperName = 'Speedy Express'

b.	What is the last name of the employee with the most orders? 
**Candidate Response:** Peacock, 40 orders
**Query** 

with cte as (SELECT orderID, EmployeeID, count(*)  as num_of_orders FROM Orders GROUP BY EmployeeID)

SELECT lastName, num_of_orders
FROM cte
JOIN employees
ON cte.employeeID = employees.employeeID
WHERE num_of_orders in (select max(num_of_orders) from cte)

c.	What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
**Candidate Response:** 40(ProductID), Boston Crab Meat(ProductName), 160(total_quant) (I am assuming the 'most' here meant by the total quantity insted of frequency)
**Query**

with cte as(SELECT a.ProductID, b.CustomerID, sum(a.Quantity) as total_quant 
FROM OrderDetails a
JOIN Orders b 
ON a.OrderID = b.OrderID
JOIN Customers c
ON b.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.Country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY a.ProductID) 

SELECT cte.ProductID, d.productName, cte.total_quant
FROM cte
JOIN Products d
ON cte.ProductID = d.ProductID
WHERE cte.total_quant in (SELECT max(total_quant) FROM cte)
